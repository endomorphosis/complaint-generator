## Suggested Handling

Review the finding in context, decide whether it represents a bug, missing test,
maintenance risk, or false positive, and land a small fix with validation. If the
finding is a false positive, document why in the changed code or discovery notes
so the supervisor does not keep re-adding the same work.
