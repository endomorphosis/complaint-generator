# Objective Bundle: refactor/g8/g8-s1

Source todo: data/refactor_supervisor/refactor_todo.md
Purpose: automatically parallelized refactor lane generated from goal/subgoal/AST scan metadata.
Conflict policy: keep edits inside this bundle when possible; rely on supervisor merge reconciliation.

- [ ] Task checkbox-23: REF-023 Cross-link IPFS datasets execution backlog tasks to refactor supervisor goals

## REF-023 Cross-link IPFS datasets execution backlog tasks to refactor supervisor goals

- Status: todo
- Completion: manual
- Priority: P0
- Track: G8
- Depends on: 
- Outputs: docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_EXECUTION_BACKLOG.md, docs/REFACTOR_SUPERVISOR_TASKBOARD.md
- Validation: python scripts/refactor_agent_supervisor.py seed --once
- Bundle: refactor/g8/g8-s1
- Bundle strategy: goal/subgoal bundle with AST-symbol locality
- Goal id: G8.S1
- Missing evidence: Existing roadmap work should feed the automated taskboard rather than drift separately.
- AST symbols: 
- Merge key: refactor/g8/g8-s1
- Candidate kind: seed
- Todo vector key: ref-023-cross-linkipfsdatasetsexecutionbacklogtaskstoref
- Acceptance: Each P0 backlog workstream maps to at least one refactor goal.; Duplicated tasks are merged or explicitly scoped.

- [ ] Task checkbox-24: REF-024 Define first three implementation claims from the queued taskboard

## REF-024 Define first three implementation claims from the queued taskboard

- Status: completed
- Completion: manual
- Priority: P0
- Track: G8
- Depends on: 
- Outputs: data/refactor_supervisor/refactor_goals.json
- Validation: python scripts/refactor_agent_supervisor.py status
- Bundle: refactor/g8/g8-s1
- Bundle strategy: goal/subgoal bundle with AST-symbol locality
- Goal id: G8.S1
- Missing evidence: A robust board still needs a practical starting order.
- AST symbols: 
- Merge key: refactor/g8/g8-s1
- Candidate kind: seed
- Todo vector key: ref-024-definefirstthreeimplementationclaimsfromthequeue
- Acceptance: The first three claims are small, testable, and dependency-ordered.; Each claim names exact validation commands.
