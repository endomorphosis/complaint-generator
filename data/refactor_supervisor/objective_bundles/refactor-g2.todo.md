# Objective Bundle: refactor/g2

Source todo: data/refactor_supervisor/refactor_todo.md
Purpose: bundle objective-generated tasks so parallel daemons can work one lane at a time.
Conflict policy: keep edits inside this bundle when possible; use the LLM merge resolver for semantic conflicts.

## REF-029 Close objective gap: Decompose oversized orchestration modules

- Status: completed
- Completion: manual
- Priority: P0
- Track: ops
- Depends on:

- Conflict policy: prefer bundle-local changes; invoke the LLM merge resolver for semantic conflicts

- Acceptance: Objective scan filed this gap for G2. Use evidence in /home/barberb/complaint-generator/data/refactor_supervisor/discovery/2026-07-21-ref-029-objective-gap-eac2cf021fa2.md, add code/tests/docs or child goals that prove the missing evidence terms are covered (objective validation repair), and keep the supervisor-fed backlog aligned with the objective heap.  Refine the objective heap if the gap needs smaller child goals.
