# Objective Bundle: refactor/g7

Source todo: data/refactor_supervisor/refactor_todo.md
Purpose: bundle objective-generated tasks so parallel daemons can work one lane at a time.
Conflict policy: keep edits inside this bundle when possible; use the LLM merge resolver for semantic conflicts.

## REF-033 Close objective gap: Rationalize frontend and review surfaces

- Status: completed

- Priority: P1
- Track: ops
- Depends on:

- Parallel lane: refactor/g7
- Conflict policy: prefer bundle-local changes; invoke the LLM merge resolver for semantic conflicts

- Acceptance: Objective scan filed this gap for G7. Use evidence in /home/barberb/complaint-generator/data/refactor_supervisor/discovery/2026-07-21-ref-033-objective-gap-eaafaa004d33.md, add code/tests/docs or child goals that prove the missing evidence terms are covered (objective validation repair), and keep the supervisor-fed backlog aligned with the objective heap.  Refine the objective heap if the gap needs smaller child goals.
