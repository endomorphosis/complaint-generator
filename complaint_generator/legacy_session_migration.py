In the March 20, 2026 thread, Benjamin Jay Barber responded that he already had a scheduled appointment to obtain a reasonable accommodation for a two-bedroom, first-floor unit and explained that a one-bedroom arrangement was not workable because Jane Kay Cortez could not climb stairs, Benjamin Barber served as her main caregiver, the two could not reasonably share a bedroom because of privacy concerns, and Jane needed ongoing assistance with ADLs and IADLs.
