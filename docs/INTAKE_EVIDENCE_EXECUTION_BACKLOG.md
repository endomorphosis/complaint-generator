## Purpose

This backlog translates the intake and evidence improvement roadmap into implementation-sized work packages tied to the current complaint-generator architecture.

The emphasis is execution, not redesign. The repo already has the core primitives. The backlog focuses on making Phase 1 and Phase 2 more explicit, more measurable, and more proof-oriented.

## Execution Principles

1. Keep [complaint_phases/phase_manager.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/complaint_phases/phase_manager.py) as the canonical workflow controller.
2. Keep normalized state and summaries in mediator and phase modules, not in application-layer request builders.
3. Treat claim-element proof readiness as the organizing principle for both phases.
4. Prefer thin vertical slices that improve behavior immediately and preserve degraded-mode operation.
5. Preserve provenance and lineage across intake facts, support tasks, artifacts, testimony, and support packets.

## Workstream Map

| ID | Workstream | Priority | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| W0 | Timeline ledger and chronology handoff | P0 | Intake and evidence share one durable event-level chronology substrate |
| W1 | Intake schema and answer normalization | P0 | Intake emits reusable, structured case facts |
| W2 | Proof-directed question planning | P0 | Questions are ranked by proof gain and novelty |
| W3 | Claim ambiguity and contradiction workflow | P0 | Uncertainty becomes explicit and actionable |
| W4 | Minimum fact bundles and evidence tasks | P0 | Phase 2 can operate on concrete support objectives |
| W5 | Support-lane unification and provenance quality | P1 | Documents, testimony, authority, and web records share one support model |
| W6 | Proof-readiness scoring and phase gates | P0 | Phase transitions depend on real support quality |
| W7 | Review and trace payload expansion | P1 | Operators can inspect why a case is or is not ready |
| W8 | Adversarial and regression enforcement | P0 | Improvements are measurable and test-protected |

## Batch 0: Timeline Ledger Foundation

Status: Planned
Priority: P0

### Goal

Make chronology a durable cross-phase object instead of a collection of summaries inferred separately in intake and evidence.

### Primary files

- [complaint_phases/intake_case_file.py](../complaint_phases/intake_case_file.py)
- [mediator/mediator.py](../mediator/mediator.py)
- [complaint_phases/phase_manager.py](../complaint_phases/phase_manager.py)
- [intake_status.py](../intake_status.py)

### Tasks

- [x] add canonical `event_ledger`, `timeline_relations`, `timeline_anchors`, and `timeline_issues` state to the intake case file
- [x] update `_apply_intake_answer_to_case_file(...)` so chronology answers create or update stable event and anchor records instead of only appending free-standing facts
- [x] update `advance_to_evidence_phase(...)`, `_summarize_intake_evidence_alignment(...)`, and `_build_alignment_evidence_tasks(...)` so temporal tasks carry event IDs, relation IDs, issue IDs, and proof objectives
- [x] extend readiness and packet summaries so unresolved timeline issues and unsupported order assumptions appear as first-class blockers
- [x] preserve the new ledger fields through `get_three_phase_status()` and `intake_status` review builders without recomputation loss

### Acceptance criteria

- the same event IDs and relation IDs created during intake are visible in evidence tasks and downstream review payloads
- chronology blockers can be explained in terms of missing anchors, missing relations, or contradictory events rather than only packet-level temporal weakness

### Suggested validation

- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_mediator_three_phase.py -q`
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_intake_status.py -q`
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_review_api.py -q`

## Batch 1: Intake Structure Foundation

Status: Planned
Priority: P0

### Goal

Make Phase 1 emit structured state that can drive evidence tasks directly.

### Primary files

- [mediator/mediator.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/mediator/mediator.py)
- [intake_status.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/intake_status.py)

### Tasks

- [x] expand `proof_leads` with owner, availability, expected format, retrieval path, and target linkage
- [x] expand `open_items` with blocking level, next-question strategy, and target element metadata
- [x] add stable `fact_id` and element-link fields to canonical facts
- [x] preserve new intake fields in `get_three_phase_status()` outputs and `intake_status` summaries

### Acceptance criteria

- a single intake answer can produce structured facts and proof leads with stable references
- unresolved intake work is visible as explicit queue items instead of implicit narrative gaps

### Suggested validation

- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_mediator_three_phase.py -q`
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_intake_status.py -q`

## Batch 2: Proof-Directed Question Planner

Status: Planned
Priority: P0

### Goal

- [mediator/mediator.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/mediator/mediator.py)

### Tasks

- [x] add expected update kind and proof-gain metadata to question candidates
- [x] rank questions by claim criticality, contradiction risk, and novelty
- [x] suppress duplicate question objectives using semantic similarity or recent-objective tracking
- [x] emit question reasons for UI, traces, and adversarial scoring

### Router dependencies

- LLM router: structured question phrasing and contradiction clarification prompts
- embeddings router: duplicate-question suppression and similarity clustering

### Acceptance criteria

- the mediator can explain what proof objective each question serves
- repeated questions fall without reducing claim-element coverage

### Suggested validation

- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_mediator.py -q`
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_mediator_three_phase.py -q`

## Batch 3: Claim Ambiguity and Contradiction Workflow

Status: Complete
Priority: P0

### Goal

Separate missingness from ambiguity and contradiction, and route each one differently.

### Primary files

- [complaint_phases/phase_manager.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/complaint_phases/phase_manager.py)
- [mediator/mediator.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/mediator/mediator.py)
- [intake_status.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/intake_status.py)

### Tasks

- [x] add contradiction severity and resolution-lane metadata
- [x] add ambiguity flags for dates, actors, conduct, and injury
- [x] add readiness blockers for unresolved blocking contradictions and unresolved claim disambiguation
- [x] route contradictions into testimony, document, or external-record tasks where appropriate

### Acceptance criteria

- intake summaries distinguish contradiction from generic missingness
- blocking contradictions prevent silent advancement to evidence phase

### Suggested validation

- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_mediator.py -q`
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_intake_status.py -q`

## Batch 4: Minimum Fact Bundles and Evidence Task Board

Status: Complete
Priority: P0

### Goal

Turn support gaps into concrete, element-level evidence tasks.

### Primary files

- [mediator/claim_support_hooks.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/mediator/claim_support_hooks.py)
- [mediator/mediator.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/mediator/mediator.py)
- [complaint_phases/phase_manager.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/complaint_phases/phase_manager.py)
- [complaint_phases/denoiser.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/complaint_phases/denoiser.py)

### Tasks

- [x] emit `missing_fact_bundle` and `satisfied_fact_bundle` per claim element during support validation
- [x] enrich `alignment_evidence_tasks` with task id, fallback lanes, source-quality target, and resolution notes
- [x] connect proof leads to target tasks through stable references
- [x] use prioritized tasks as the canonical Phase 2 next-action source

### Acceptance criteria

- every unresolved element produces an explainable task with a concrete success target
- evidence questioning in Phase 2 is driven from task structure rather than generic prompts

### Suggested validation

- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_mediator_three_phase.py -q`
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_claim_support_hooks.py -q`

## Batch 5: Support Lane Unification and Provenance Quality

Status: In Progress
Priority: P1

### Goal

Make documentary evidence, testimony, authority, and web captures comparable support lanes.

### Primary files

- [mediator/evidence_hooks.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/mediator/evidence_hooks.py)

- [docs/EVIDENCE_MANAGEMENT.md](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/docs/EVIDENCE_MANAGEMENT.md)

### Tasks

- [x] normalize provenance fields across artifact and testimony records
- [x] add support-quality labels that distinguish testimony-only, documentary, corroborated, and contradicted states
- [x] preserve lane identity and quality through support summaries and snapshots (`support_lane_label_counts` and `support_quality_counts` added to per-claim alignment summary and aggregated in `build_intake_case_review_summary`)
- [ ] persist meaningful case-theory or support-packet snapshots through the IPFS-backed path when state materially changes

### Router dependencies

- IPFS router: content-addressed snapshots and artifact lineage
- embeddings router: artifact and testimony grouping around shared events or facts

### Acceptance criteria

- support summaries can explain not only whether support exists, but what type and quality of support exists
- operators can trace packet conclusions back to stored source lineage

### Suggested validation

- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_claim_support_hooks.py -q`
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_document_pipeline.py -q`

## Batch 6: Proof-Readiness Gates

Status: Complete
Priority: P0

### Goal

Make Phase 1 and Phase 2 transitions depend on semantic readiness, not just coarse gap counts.

### Primary files

- [complaint_phases/phase_manager.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/complaint_phases/phase_manager.py)
- [mediator/mediator.py](/home/barberb/complaint-generator/mediator/mediator.py)

- [x] gate formalization on proof-readiness score and explicit blocker lists
- [x] preserve these metrics through review and optimization summaries

### Acceptance criteria

- a case can be complaint-ready but not proof-ready, and that difference is explicit
- unsupported core elements are surfaced before drafting starts

### Suggested validation

- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_document_pipeline.py -q`
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_parallel_validation_fix.py -q`

- [x] expose `support_lane_label_counts` and `support_quality_counts` aggregated across claims in `build_intake_case_review_summary` (inside `claim_support_packet_summary`)
- [x] surface lane distribution and quality chips in claim_support_review.html, document.html, and optimization_trace.html
- [x] preserve architecture boundaries by keeping payload shaping out of application-only logic where possible
- [x] ensure optimizer traces retain the expanded intake and evidence state

### Acceptance criteria

- operators can explain why a case is blocked without inspecting raw graph or ledger rows
- traces can replay the intake-to-evidence progression coherently

### Suggested validation

- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_review_api.py -q`
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_claim_support_review_playwright_smoke.py -q`

## Batch 8: Validation Harness and Metrics

Status: Complete
Priority: P0

### Goal

Make the improvements measurable in automated runs.

### Primary files

- [x] add Phase 2 metrics for support sufficiency, support quality, and proof readiness
- [x] add fixtures for retaliation, discrimination, housing, and consumer scenarios with distinct proof burdens
- [x] update critic prompts or scoring rubrics to reward question relevance and proof progress instead of verbosity

### Acceptance criteria

- improvements are visible in adversarial batches, not only in manual demos
- regressions in proof readiness or question precision become test-detectable

### Suggested validation

- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_document_pipeline.py -q --run-llm`

## Recommended Execution Order

1. Batch 1: Intake structure foundation
2. Batch 2: Proof-directed question planner
3. Batch 3: Claim ambiguity and contradiction workflow
4. Batch 4: Minimum fact bundles and evidence task board
5. Batch 6: Proof-readiness gates
6. Batch 5: Support lane unification and provenance quality
7. Batch 7: Review and trace surfaces
8. Batch 8: Validation harness and metrics

## First Coding Slice Recommendation

The best first coding slice is:

1. expand intake proof leads and open items
2. normalize answer application into element-linked canonical facts
3. enrich alignment evidence tasks with success criteria and fallback lanes
4. emit minimum fact bundles from support validation
5. extend phase gates with proof-readiness metrics

That slice improves intake, evidence organization, and review surfaces at the same time with manageable code churn.
