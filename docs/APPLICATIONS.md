# Applications Guide

This document describes the user-facing applications in the Complaint Generator system, including the command-line interface (CLI) and web server.

The review operator surface also has dedicated app factories for non-legacy deployments:

- `applications.create_review_api_app(mediator)` mounts only the claim-support review and follow-up execution API routes.
- `applications.create_review_dashboard_app()` mounts only the `/claim-support-review` HTML dashboard.
- `applications.create_review_surface_app(mediator)` mounts both the dashboard UI and the review/follow-up API routes on one FastAPI app.

The repository also includes `config.review_surface.json` for launching the combined review surface through `run.py`, and `config.review_surface.huggingface_router.json` for launching that same surface against Hugging Face router/inference by default.

## Overview

The Complaint Generator provides two primary application interfaces and dedicated review-surface variants:

1. **CLI Application** - Interactive command-line interface for legal complaint generation
2. **Web Server** - FastAPI-based web application with REST API and WebSocket support
3. **Review Surface Apps** - Focused FastAPI apps for the claim-support dashboard and review APIs

All application variants use the same underlying mediator and processing pipeline, providing consistent functionality across interfaces.

## CLI Application

### Features

The CLI application (`applications/cli.py`) provides an interactive terminal interface for:

- **User Authentication** - Username/password login with profile persistence
- **Interactive Dialogue** - Natural conversation for complaint intake
- **State Management** - Save and resume complaint sessions
- **Command Interface** - Special commands for workflow control

### Starting the CLI

```bash
python run.py --config config.llm_router.json
```

Ensure your configuration file has CLI enabled:

```json
{
  "APPLICATION": {
    "type": ["cli"]
  }
}
```

### Usage

When you start the CLI, you'll see:

```
*** JusticeDAO / Complaint Generator v1.0 ***

commands are:
!reset      wipe current state and start over
!resume     resumes from a statefile from disk
!save       saves current state to disk
!claim-review [claim_type] [key=value]
!execute-follow-up [claim_type] [key=value]
!export-complaint [output_dir] [key=value]

Username:
>
```

#### Authentication

1. Enter your username when prompted
2. Enter your password when prompted
3. The system loads your profile or creates a new one

#### Interactive Mode

After authentication, the system enters interactive mode where:

- The mediator asks questions to gather complaint information
- You provide answers in natural language
- Press Enter without typing to continue the conversation
- Use special commands (prefixed with `!`) for workflow control

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!reset` | Wipe current state and start over with a new complaint |
| `!save` | Save current conversation state to disk |
| `!resume` | Load a previously saved state from disk |
| `!claim-review` | Print a compact parse-quality review summary, plus follow-up authority search-program counts, graph-source-context mixes, and recent selected-program or source-lineage history mixes when present, and then the claim-support review payload in JSON for a claim type |
| `!execute-follow-up` | Execute follow-up retrieval tasks, print a compact execution-quality summary with the canonical `recommended_next_action` when parse-quality remediation is still needed, include authority search-program counts plus graph-source-context and post-execution selected-program history mixes when present, and then print the execution payload in JSON |
| `!export-complaint` | Build a court-style complaint draft and render document artifacts such as DOCX and PDF, then print a compact summary and the full package JSON |

Review command examples:

```text
!claim-review claim_type="employment retaliation"
!claim-review "civil rights" include_follow_up_plan=false
!execute-follow-up "civil rights" follow_up_support_kind=authority follow_up_max_tasks_per_claim=1
!execute-follow-up claim_type=retaliation follow_up_force=true include_post_execution_review=false
!export-complaint statefiles district="Northern District of California" plaintiff_names="Jane Doe" defendant_names="Acme Corporation" case_number=25-cv-00001 output_formats=docx,pdf
!export-complaint statefiles district="Northern District of California" plaintiff_names="Jane Doe" defendant_names="Acme Corporation" affidavit_supporting_exhibits='[{"label":"Affidavit Ex. 1","title":"HR Complaint Email","link":"https://example.org/hr-email.pdf","summary":"Email reporting discrimination to HR."}]' affidavit_include_complaint_exhibits=false output_formats=docx,pdf,txt
```

Supported `key=value` options:

- `claim_type`
- `user_id`
- `follow_up_cooldown_seconds`
- `follow_up_support_kind`
- `follow_up_max_tasks_per_claim`
- `include_support_summary`
- `include_overview`
- `include_follow_up_plan`
- `required_support_kinds` as a comma-separated list such as `required_support_kinds=evidence,authority`
- `include_post_execution_review`
- `execute_follow_up` on `!claim-review` for backward-compatible opt-in execution
- `follow_up_force` on `!execute-follow-up`
- `court_name`, `district`, `division`, `case_number`, `court_header_override`, `title_override`, `output_dir`
- `plaintiff_names`, `defendant_names`, `requested_relief`, and `output_formats` as comma-separated lists when used with `!export-complaint`
- `affidavit_supporting_exhibits` as a JSON array when used with `!export-complaint`; when supplied, the affidavit uses this curated exhibit list instead of inheriting the complaint exhibits
- `affidavit_include_complaint_exhibits=false` on `!export-complaint` to suppress mirrored complaint exhibits from the affidavit when no affidavit-specific exhibit list is provided

### Profile Storage

User profiles are stored with:
- Username and hashed password
- Complaint conversation history
- Answered questions
- Timestamps for session tracking

Profiles are persisted in the state management system (DuckDB) for future sessions.

## Web Server Application

### Features

The web server (`applications/server.py`) provides:

- **REST API Endpoints** - HTTP endpoints for complaint processing
- **WebSocket Support** - Real-time bidirectional communication
- **JWT Authentication** - Secure token-based authentication
- **HTML Templates** - Web UI for complaint generation
- **Cookie-Based Sessions** - Persistent user sessions

### Starting the Server

```bash
python run.py --config config.llm_router.json
```

Ensure your configuration file has server enabled:

```json
{
  "APPLICATION": {
    "type": ["server"]
  }
}
```

The server starts on the configured host and port (typically `http://localhost:8000` or as configured).

## Review Surface Application

The dedicated review surface can be started without the broader legacy web app:

```bash
python run.py --config config.review_surface.json
```

To launch the same review/document surface with Hugging Face router inference as the active backend:

```bash
python run.py --config config.review_surface.huggingface_router.json
```

Set `HF_TOKEN` or `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN` before starting the app when the selected Hugging Face model requires authentication.

This mode serves:

- `/claim-support-review` for the operator dashboard
- `/document` for the browser-based formal complaint builder and preview surface
- `/api/claim-support/review` for read-only review payloads
- `/api/claim-support/execute-follow-up` for explicit follow-up execution
- `/api/documents/formal-complaint` for building formal complaint drafts and rendering DOCX/PDF artifacts
- `/api/documents/download` for downloading generated DOCX/PDF artifacts from the managed output directory
- `/health` for lightweight liveness and readiness checks on the dedicated review app

The formal complaint endpoint also accepts agentic optimization controls, including `optimization_provider`, `optimization_model_name`, and `optimization_llm_config`, so the browser builder or external callers can route optimization traffic through the same Hugging Face router endpoint when needed. The `/document` builder exposes both simple router fields and an advanced JSON editor for `optimization_llm_config`, with the simple fields overriding matching top-level keys for quick experimentation.

Legacy claim-support testimony rows can be normalized proactively with the standalone maintenance command:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/backfill_claim_testimony_links.py \
  --db-path statefiles/claim_support.duckdb \
  --dry-run

.venv/bin/python scripts/backfill_claim_testimony_links.py \
  --db-path statefiles/claim_support.duckdb
```

Use `--user-id` and `--claim-type` to scope the repair when you only want to update one operator or one claim family.

### API Endpoints

#### GET Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description | Returns |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `/` | Main landing page | HTML template (index.html) |
| `/home` | Home page after login | HTML template (home.html) |
| `/chat` | Chat interface | HTML template (chat.html) |

#### POST Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description | Returns |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `/api/claim-support/review` | Claim-element review packet for operator or UI workflows | JSON payload with `claim_coverage_matrix`, `claim_coverage_summary`, `claim_support_gaps`, `claim_contradiction_candidates`, optional `support_summary`, `claim_overview`, `follow_up_plan`, compact `follow_up_plan_summary`, and persisted `follow_up_history` or `follow_up_history_summary`; authority-targeted follow-up summaries can also expose compact legal-retrieval warning aggregates such as `search_warning_count`, `warning_family_counts`, `warning_code_counts`, `hf_dataset_id_counts`, and `search_warning_summary`; coverage payloads include compact support-lineage packet summaries for archived captures and authority fallbacks; `follow_up_execution` remains compatibility-only |
| `/api/claim-support/execute-follow-up` | Explicit side-effecting follow-up execution endpoint | JSON payload with `follow_up_execution`, lineage-aware `follow_up_execution_summary`, optional `execution_quality_summary`, and optional `post_execution_review` with refreshed `follow_up_history_summary`; authority executions can also expose compact legal-retrieval warning aggregates such as `search_warning_count`, `warning_family_counts`, `warning_code_counts`, `hf_dataset_id_counts`, and `search_warning_summary` |
| `/api/claim-support/save-testimony` | Persist a structured testimony record for the current claim-support review context | JSON payload with `testimony_result`, `recorded`, and optional `post_save_review` using the standard review contract; save-time canonicalization resolves text-only claim elements to registered `claim_element_id` values when the match is unambiguous |
| `/api/claim-support/save-document` | Persist pasted document text for the current claim-support review context through the shared evidence parse, chunk, and graph pipeline | JSON payload with `document_result`, `recorded`, and optional `post_save_review` using the standard review contract |
| `/api/claim-support/upload-document` | Persist an uploaded file for the current claim-support review context through the shared evidence parse, chunk, and graph pipeline | Multipart form response with `document_result`, `recorded`, and optional `post_save_review` using the standard review contract |
| `/api/documents/formal-complaint` | Formal complaint export endpoint for court-style pleading drafts | JSON payload with the structured draft, generated artifact paths, selected output formats, generation timestamp, and claim-level drafting-readiness or support-summary context used by the builder preview |
| `/api/documents/download` | Download a generated complaint artifact from the managed output directory | Generated DOCX or PDF file response |

##### `/api/claim-support/review` - Claim Support Review

POST a small JSON request to retrieve the current claim-support review state without running the full automatic research workflow.

Example request:

```json
{
  "claim_type": "retaliation",
  "required_support_kinds": ["evidence", "authority"],
  "follow_up_cooldown_seconds": 3600,
  "include_support_summary": true,
  "include_overview": true,
  "include_follow_up_plan": true,
  "execute_follow_up": false,
  "follow_up_support_kind": null,
  "follow_up_max_tasks_per_claim": 3
}
```

Example response fields:

- `claim_coverage_matrix`: detailed per-claim and per-element grouped support links, plus per-element `support_packets` and `support_packet_summary` lineage rollups.
- `claim_coverage_summary`: compact status counts plus missing, unresolved, contradiction, parse-quality, authority-treatment, and `support_packet_summary` lineage labels.
- `claim_coverage_summary[*].parse_quality_recommendation`: canonical compact recommendation exposed to the CLI and dashboard when parse-quality gaps remain.
- `claim_coverage_summary[*].authority_treatment_summary`: compact supportive-versus-adverse-versus-uncertain authority counts plus treatment-type mix for review tooling.
- The review dashboard currently renders per-element `support_packets` archive-first and fallback-next for operator triage, but API callers should treat packet ordering as presentation-specific unless they apply their own sort.
- `claim_support_gaps`: unresolved-element diagnostics keyed by claim type.
- `claim_contradiction_candidates`: heuristic contradiction candidates keyed by claim type.
- `question_recommendations`: targeted operator-facing question packets keyed by claim type, grouped around contradiction resolution, testimony clarification, document requests, or authority clarification.
- `testimony_records`: persisted testimony rows keyed by claim type. Legacy rows missing `claim_element_id` are lazily repaired on read when the registered claim-element match is unambiguous.
- `testimony_summary`: compact testimony counts keyed by claim type, including linked-element counts plus firsthand and confidence buckets.
- `document_artifacts`: persisted dashboard-ingested evidence artifacts keyed by claim type, including parse, chunk, fact, and graph previews for uploaded or pasted materials.
- `document_summary`: compact document-artifact counts keyed by claim type, including linked-element counts, total chunks, total facts, graph-ready counts, low-quality parse counts, and parse-status mix.
- `support_summary`: persisted support-link summary keyed by claim type.
- `claim_overview`: covered, partially supported, and missing element buckets keyed by claim type.
- `follow_up_plan`: actionable retrieval tasks keyed by claim type; authority-targeted tasks now include claim-aware `authority_search_programs` bundles and a compact `authority_search_program_summary`.
- `follow_up_plan_summary`: compact task, suppression, graph-support, parse-remediation, chronology-follow-up, graph-source-context, and optional legal-retrieval warning counts keyed by claim type.
- `follow_up_history`: recent persisted follow-up execution and manual-review rows keyed by claim type; graph-backed executions can flatten dominant source-lineage fields such as `source_family`, `artifact_family`, and `content_origin` onto each row for compact operator and CLI review.
- `follow_up_history_summary`: compact history ledger counts keyed by claim type, including selected authority-program mixes, adaptive retry counts, chronology-follow-up aggregates, persisted graph-source-context families, and optional legal-retrieval warning aggregates when authority execution stored Hugging Face search warnings.
- `follow_up_execution`: compatibility-only opt-in execution results keyed by claim type when `execute_follow_up=true`.
- `follow_up_execution_summary`: compatibility-only compact execution, suppression, cooldown-skip, graph-support, graph-source-context, and optional legal-retrieval warning counts keyed by claim type.
- `compatibility_notice`: route-level deprecation metadata returned only when `execute_follow_up=true`.

If `user_id` is omitted, the endpoint resolves it from the mediator state and falls back to `anonymous`.
If `execute_follow_up` is omitted or `false`, the endpoint remains read-only and does not trigger retrieval side effects.
New clients should prefer `/api/claim-support/execute-follow-up` when they want side effects, and treat `execute_follow_up` on the review endpoint as a backward-compatible bridge.
When the compatibility path is used, the response also includes `Deprecation`, `Sunset`, `Link`, and `Warning` headers pointing callers at `/api/claim-support/execute-follow-up`.

##### `/api/claim-support/execute-follow-up` - Follow-Up Execution

POST to this endpoint when the caller wants an explicit execution surface rather than using the compatibility `execute_follow_up` flag on the review endpoint.

Example request:

```json
{
  "claim_type": "retaliation",
  "required_support_kinds": ["evidence", "authority"],
  "follow_up_cooldown_seconds": 3600,
  "follow_up_support_kind": "evidence",
  "follow_up_max_tasks_per_claim": 1,
  "follow_up_force": false,
  "include_post_execution_review": true,
  "include_support_summary": true,
  "include_overview": true,
  "include_follow_up_plan": true
}
```

Example response fields:

- `follow_up_execution`: raw execution results keyed by claim type.

##### `/api/documents/formal-complaint` - Formal Complaint Export

POST to this endpoint to build a filing-style complaint package from the current intake, legal analysis, claim support, and evidence context. The export includes a court caption, parties, nature of the action, summary of facts, fuller factual allegations, claims for relief, legal standards, requested relief, and linked exhibits.

The browser UI for this workflow is available at `/document`, which submits to this endpoint and renders artifact download links, section-level drafting readiness, claim-level filing warnings, compact claim-level source context, and the generated pleading text from the response payload.

Example request:

```json
{
  "district": "Northern District of California",
  "case_number": "25-cv-00001",
  "plaintiff_names": ["Jane Doe"],
  "defendant_names": ["Acme Corporation"],
  "enable_agentic_optimization": true,
  "optimization_max_iterations": 2,
  "optimization_target_score": 0.9,
  "optimization_provider": "huggingface_router",
  "optimization_model_name": "Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct",
  "optimization_llm_config": {
    "base_url": "https://router.huggingface.co/v1",
    "headers": {
      "X-Title": "Complaint Generator"
    }
  },
  "affidavit_include_complaint_exhibits": false,
  "output_formats": ["docx", "pdf", "txt", "checklist"]
}
```

Optimization controls:

- `enable_agentic_optimization`: runs a post-knowledge-graph refinement loop before artifact rendering.
- `optimization_max_iterations` / `optimization_target_score`: bounds the loop and stopping threshold.
- `optimization_provider` / `optimization_model_name`: selects the routed model used by the actor and critic prompts.
- `optimization_llm_config`: optional provider-specific router overrides such as `base_url`, headers, timeouts, or nested routing settings. In the `/document` UI, the advanced JSON editor is merged with the simple router fields, and the simple fields win on conflicts.
- `optimization_persist_artifacts`: stores the optimization trace through the IPFS adapter and surfaces the resulting CID in the response.

When the `/document` UI is used, the generated preview also renders a compact optimization summary with router availability, router usage diagnostics, upstream optimizer metadata, stage-level provider selection, packet projection counts, initial/final critic review summaries, routed provider/model/source details, trace status, and section-history lines so operators can review the refinement loop without opening the raw JSON payload.

Minimal TXT-only optimization request:

```json
{
  "district": "Northern District of California",
  "county": "San Francisco County",
  "plaintiff_names": ["Jane Doe"],
  "defendant_names": ["Acme Corporation"],
  "enable_agentic_optimization": true,
  "optimization_max_iterations": 1,
  "optimization_target_score": 0.9,
  "output_formats": ["txt"]
}
```

Affidavit exhibit behavior:

- Leave `affidavit_include_complaint_exhibits` unset or set it to `true` to keep the default behavior of mirroring complaint exhibits into the affidavit when no affidavit-specific exhibit list is supplied.
- Set `affidavit_include_complaint_exhibits` to `false` when the affidavit should omit mirrored complaint exhibits unless `affidavit_supporting_exhibits` is explicitly provided.

Expanded affidavit override example:

```json
{
  "district": "Northern District of California",
  "county": "San Francisco County",
  "case_number": "25-cv-00001",
  "plaintiff_names": ["Jane Doe"],
  "defendant_names": ["Acme Corporation"],
  "affidavit_title": "AFFIDAVIT OF JANE DOE REGARDING RETALIATION",
  "affidavit_intro": "I, Jane Doe, make this affidavit from personal knowledge regarding Defendant's retaliation.",
  "affidavit_facts": [
    "I reported discrimination to human resources on March 3, 2026.",
    "Defendant terminated my employment two days later."
  ],
  "affidavit_supporting_exhibits": [
    {
      "label": "Affidavit Ex. 1",
      "title": "HR Complaint Email",
      "link": "https://example.org/hr-email.pdf",
      "summary": "Email reporting discrimination to human resources."
    }
  ],
  "affidavit_include_complaint_exhibits": false,
  "affidavit_venue_lines": [
    "State of California",
    "County of San Francisco"
  ],
  "affidavit_jurat": "Subscribed and sworn to before me on March 13, 2026 by Jane Doe.",
  "affidavit_notary_block": [
    "__________________________________",
    "Notary Public for the State of California",
    "My commission expires: March 13, 2029"
  ],
  "output_formats": ["docx", "pdf", "txt"]
}
```

  ],
  "output_formats": ["docx", "pdf", "txt"]
}
JSON
```

Example response fields:

- `draft`: structured complaint content used for rendering.
- `draft.factual_allegations`: expanded pleading-body allegations assembled from the summary facts plus claim-specific supporting facts, with intake-style prompt prefixes and generic support boilerplate filtered out before paragraph numbering.
- `draft.factual_allegation_paragraphs`: numbered allegation entries used by the preview to keep one paragraph numbering scheme across the pleading.
- `draft.draft_text`: copy-ready pleading text synthesized from the same structured draft used for DOCX and PDF rendering.
- `draft.claims_for_relief[*].allegation_references`: paragraph numbers each count incorporates by reference from the factual allegations section, surfaced in the preview and rendered pleadings as `¶` / `¶¶` citations.
- `draft.claims_for_relief[*].supporting_exhibits`: exhibit labels and links used alongside the paragraph citations to build the count-level incorporated-support block in the preview and rendered pleading.
- `draft.claims_for_relief[*].support_summary`: compact per-claim support counts used by the builder, including lane counts plus source-family or artifact-family context when the persisted claim-support summary already has lineage-rich packet aggregates.
- `draft.verification`: generated verification block rendered into the complaint body and export artifacts; state-oriented drafts use state-style verification language and `Verified on`, while federal-style drafts keep the penalty-of-perjury wording and `Executed on`.
- `draft.certificate_of_service`: generated service block rendered into the complaint body and export artifacts; the title and body adapt to the resolved forum style, for example `Proof of Service` in state-oriented drafts.
- `draft.affidavit`: generated affidavit metadata used by the builder preview and affidavit export artifacts, including venue lines, numbered fact statements, supporting exhibits, jurat text, and notary block lines; state-oriented drafts can switch to sworn language and omit the `(or affirmed)` wording in the default jurat.
- `drafting_readiness`: section-level and claim-level filing-readiness signals surfaced in the builder preview.
- `drafting_readiness.claims[*].source_family_counts` / `artifact_family_counts` / `content_origin_counts`: compact source-context counts lifted from persisted claim-support summaries so the builder preview can show where claim support currently comes from without sending users back to the review dashboard first.
- `drafting_readiness.claims[*].review_intent` / `drafting_readiness.sections[*].review_intent`: normalized claim- and section-scoped review focus metadata that browsers or other clients can persist without rebuilding the query string by hand.
- `filing_checklist`: operator-facing pre-filing checklist items derived from the readiness payload, including direct review links and `review_intent` metadata for claim- and section-specific remediation in the builder preview.
- `review_links`: API-layer navigation metadata pointing back to `/claim-support-review` for the current user context, specific claim types, and section-specific drafting review links, including per-claim section links for multi-claim drafts and matching `review_intent` objects.
- `review_intent`: top-level server-rendered review focus chosen from the current readiness warnings so the document builder can restore the most relevant dashboard context without relying only on browser-local history.
- `artifacts.docx.path`: filesystem path to the generated DOCX document when requested.
- `artifacts.pdf.path`: filesystem path to the generated PDF document when requested.
- `artifacts.txt.path`: filesystem path to the generated plain-text pleading when requested.
- `artifacts.affidavit_docx.path`, `artifacts.affidavit_pdf.path`, `artifacts.affidavit_txt.path`: filesystem paths to the generated affidavit companion documents when the matching output formats are requested.
- `artifacts.checklist.path`: filesystem path to the generated plain-text pre-filing checklist artifact when requested, including embedded review URLs for direct remediation follow-up.
- `document_optimization`: present only when optimization is enabled. The current payload includes `status`, `method`, `optimizer_backend`, `initial_score`, `final_score`, `iteration_count`, `accepted_iterations`, `optimized_sections`, `artifact_cid`, `trace_storage`, `trace_download_url`, `trace_view_url`, `router_status`, `router_usage`, `upstream_optimizer`, `intake_status`, `intake_constraints`, `packet_projection`, and `section_history`.
- `artifacts.*.download_url`: application route for downloading generated artifacts when they were written under the managed output directory.
- `output_formats`: formats rendered for the request.
- `generated_at`: UTC timestamp for the export operation.

##### `/api/documents/download` - Generated Artifact Download

GET this endpoint with a `path` query parameter returned from the formal complaint export payload when you want the application to stream a generated artifact back to the browser.

##### `/api/documents/optimization-trace` - Persisted Optimization Trace Replay

GET this endpoint with the `cid` returned in `document_optimization.artifact_cid` or use `document_optimization.trace_download_url` directly when you want the application to fetch the persisted optimization trace through the IPFS adapter and return the decoded JSON payload.

##### `/document/optimization-trace` - Optimization Trace Viewer

GET this page with a `cid` query parameter, or use `document_optimization.trace_view_url`, when you want a browser-friendly audit view that loads the persisted optimization trace and renders intake blockers, contradiction summaries, review scores, iteration history, and the raw JSON trace in one place.

This route only serves files from the managed generated-documents directory and rejects requests outside that boundary.

Use this endpoint for new clients that want execution to be unambiguously side-effecting. The review endpoint remains available for read-only review and backward-compatible opt-in execution.

#### WebSocket Endpoints

##### `/api/chat` - Real-time Chat

WebSocket endpoint for real-time complaint processing:

**Connection:**
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/api/chat');
```

**Authentication:**
- Requires `Authorization` cookie with JWT token
- Also accepts `hashed_username` and `hashed_password` cookies

**Message Format:**
```javascript
// Send
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: "message",
  content: "Your complaint text here"
}));

// Receive
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log(data);
};
```

**Broadcast Messages:**
The server broadcasts messages to all connected clients when:
- A user connects: `{"hashed_username": "...", "message": "got connected"}`
- A user disconnects: `{"hashed_username": "...", "message": "left"}`
- A user sends a message: `{...message data...}`

### Authentication

The server uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication:

#### Token Generation

```python
def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: timedelta = None):
    # Returns a JWT token valid for 30 minutes (default)
    # or specified expiration time
```

**Token Payload:**
- User data (username, permissions, etc.)
- Expiration timestamp
- Issued at timestamp

**Algorithm:** HS256 (HMAC with SHA-256)

#### Cookie-Based Authentication

The server expects authentication cookies:
- `Authorization` - JWT token
- `hashed_username` - Hashed username
- `hashed_password` - Hashed password

**⚠️ Security Note:** The current implementation has a hardcoded JWT secret key in the source code. This should be moved to environment variables or a secure configuration system for production use.

### HTML Templates

The server uses Jinja2 templates located in the `templates/` directory:

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `index.html` | Landing page with login |
| `home.html` | Main dashboard after authentication |
| `chat.html` | Interactive chat interface for complaints |
| `claim_support_review.html` | Operator dashboard for claim review and follow-up execution |
| `profile.html` | User profile management |
| `results.html` | Display generated complaint results |
| `document.html` | Document viewer/editor (WYSIWYG) |
| `login.html` | Login form |
| `register.html` | User registration |
| `unauthorized.html` | 403 error page |

### WebSocket Connection Manager

The server includes a `SocketManager` class for managing WebSocket connections:

```python
class SocketManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_connections: list[(WebSocket, str)] = []
    
    async def connect(websocket: WebSocket, user: str)
    def disconnect(websocket: WebSocket, user: str)
    async def broadcast(data: dict)  # Broadcast to all connected clients
```

## Running Both Applications

You can run the CLI together with one web surface:

```json
{
  "APPLICATION": {
    "type": ["cli", "review-surface"]
  }
}
```

This starts the selected web surface in the background and then enters the CLI.

## Application Entry Points

### main.py

The primary entry point (`main.py`) provides:
- Configuration loading from `config.llm_router.json`
- Backend initialization (OpenAI, LLM Router, Workstation)
- Mediator setup with configured backends
- Application instantiation (CLI and/or Server)

### run.py

Alternative entry point (`run.py`) with simplified interface:
- Loads configuration
- Initializes backends and mediator
- Starts configured applications

## Configuration

Applications are configured in `config.llm_router.json`:

```json
{
  "APPLICATION": {
    "type": ["review-surface"],
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 8000
  },
  "BACKENDS": [...],
  "MEDIATOR": {...},
  "LOG": {
    "level": "INFO"
  }
}
```

The repository root also includes `config.review_surface.json` as a ready-to-run focused operator profile.

See [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for complete configuration reference.

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

1. **Hardcoded Secrets** - The server has a hardcoded JWT secret key that should be moved to environment variables
2. **Hostname** - Hardcoded hostname `http://10.10.0.10:1792` should be configurable
3. **Password Hashing** - The CLI uses "hashed" passwords, but the hashing mechanism is not clearly defined
4. **HTTPS** - The server runs on HTTP by default; HTTPS should be configured for production

### Recommended Improvements

For production deployment:

1. **Use Environment Variables:**
```python
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('JWT_SECRET_KEY')
HOSTNAME = os.environ.get('SERVER_HOSTNAME', 'http://localhost:8000')
```

2. **Proper Password Hashing:**
```python
from passlib.context import CryptContext
pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")
```

3. **HTTPS Configuration:**
```python
uvicorn.run(
    app,
    host="0.0.0.0",
    port=8443,
    ssl_keyfile="/path/to/key.pem",
    ssl_certfile="/path/to/cert.pem"
)
```

4. **Rate Limiting** - Add rate limiting for API endpoints
5. **CORS Configuration** - Configure CORS for cross-origin requests
6. **Input Validation** - Validate and sanitize all user inputs

See [docs/SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for comprehensive security guidelines.

## Development

### Adding New Endpoints

To add a new REST endpoint:

```python
@app.get("/your-endpoint")
async def your_handler(request: Request):
    # Your logic here
    return {"result": "data"}
```

### Adding WebSocket Handlers

To add a new WebSocket endpoint:

```python
@app.websocket("/api/your-socket")
async def your_socket(websocket: WebSocket):
    await manager.connect(websocket, user_id)
    try:
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_json()
            # Process data
            await manager.broadcast(response)
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        manager.disconnect(websocket, user_id)
```

### Adding New Templates

1. Create HTML template in `templates/`
2. Add route handler to serve the template
3. Use Jinja2 templating for dynamic content

## Troubleshooting

### CLI Issues

**Problem:** "Username/Password not accepted"
- Check that your credentials are correct
- Verify profile storage is working (DuckDB accessible)

**Problem:** "Commands not working"
- Ensure commands start with `!`
- Check command spelling (`!reset`, `!save`, `!resume`)

### Server Issues

**Problem:** "Port already in use"
```bash
# Find and kill process using the port
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
```

**Problem:** "WebSocket connection failed"
- Verify JWT token is valid and not expired
- Check authentication cookies are set correctly
- Ensure WebSocket URL matches server configuration

**Problem:** "Template not found"
- Verify `templates/` directory exists
- Check template file names match route handlers
- Ensure working directory is repository root

### Authentication Issues

**Problem:** "JWT token expired"
- Tokens expire after 30 minutes by default
- Request a new token by re-authenticating

**Problem:** "Invalid token signature"
- Ensure SECRET_KEY matches between token creation and validation
- Do not modify JWT token contents
