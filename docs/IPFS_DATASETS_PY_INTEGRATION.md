# IPFS Datasets Py Integration Guide

Date: 2026-03-11

## Purpose

Describe how complaint-generator should use the `ipfs_datasets_py` submodule in production, based on the current repository state.

This document is the practical integration guide that sits between:

- [docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md](docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)
- [docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_EXECUTION_BACKLOG.md](docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_EXECUTION_BACKLOG.md)
- [docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_NEXT_BATCH_PLAN.md](docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_NEXT_BATCH_PLAN.md)
- [docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md](docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md)
- [docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_MILESTONE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_MILESTONE_CHECKLIST.md)
- [docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_FILE_WORKLIST.md](docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_FILE_WORKLIST.md)
- [docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md](docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md)

The main principle is simple: complaint-generator remains the orchestrator, and `ipfs_datasets_py` provides acquisition, parsing, graph, archival, retrieval, and reasoning capabilities through the adapter layer under `integrations/ipfs_datasets/`.

## Adapter-First Guidance

When writing complaint-generator code examples, prefer adapter imports from `integrations/ipfs_datasets/*` instead of direct `ipfs_datasets_py.*` imports.

Use direct upstream import examples only when the document is intentionally describing upstream package internals or upstream-only experimentation.

This keeps complaint-generator docs aligned with the actual production boundary, degraded-mode behavior, and normalized payload contracts used by mediator flows.

## Integration Goals

The `ipfs_datasets_py` integration should improve complaint-generator in five concrete ways:

1. Acquire legal and factual source material more broadly and more reproducibly.
2. Normalize that material into shared artifacts, chunks, facts, graph metadata, and provenance records.
3. Organize support by claim element instead of by raw search result or upload source.
4. Improve retrieval quality with archival, graph, and eventually vector and GraphRAG signals.
5. Enable formal validation and contradiction analysis once graph and predicate layers mature.

## Current Production Boundary

All production-facing `ipfs_datasets_py` usage should flow through these adapter modules:

- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/capabilities.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/loader.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/storage.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/search.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/legal.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/documents.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/graphs.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/graphrag.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/logic.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/vector_store.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/mcp_gateway.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/provenance.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/types.py`
- `integrations/ipfs_datasets/scraper_daemon.py`

This boundary is already important operationally because it gives complaint-generator:

- capability detection and degraded-mode support
- a place for sync or async normalization wrappers
- consistent payload contracts for mediator hooks
- insulation from submodule package layout drift

## What Is Already Integrated

### Evidence and artifact storage

Complaint-generator already uses the IPFS-backed storage adapter in the evidence path. Uploaded evidence and discovered web evidence can be normalized, deduplicated, stored, and linked back to claim elements.

Operationally, this already includes:

- provenance-aware evidence storage
- content-hash and CID-aware deduplication
- persisted evidence rows in DuckDB
- parse summaries, chunk rows, graph metadata, and extracted fact persistence for parsed evidence

### Web search, scraping, and archival acquisition

Complaint-generator already uses adapter-backed search and scraping flows for:

- Brave-style current web search
- Common Crawl search
- direct page scraping
- archive-domain sweeps
- bounded agentic scraper optimization loops

The scraper path is no longer only an in-process helper. It now has:

- persisted scraper run history
- tactic-level performance tracking
- coverage ledgers
- a queue-backed worker model so scraper jobs only execute when there is queued work

### Legal source acquisition

Legal authority acquisition is already routed through the adapter layer and normalized into complaint-generator records. This provides a real base for deeper authority ranking and formal rule translation, even though authority parsing and contradiction analysis are still incomplete.

### Graph enrichment

Complaint-generator already has useful graph integration in place:

- graph extraction can run during evidence ingestion
- graph entities and relationships can be persisted as evidence-linked metadata
- graph projections can be pushed into the complaint-phase knowledge graph
- support edges can be linked back to claim elements

This means the remaining graph work is not “add graphs.” It is “add graph persistence, graph querying, and graph-backed organization at case scale.”

## Capability Areas and Recommended Use

### 1. Legal scrapers and legal dataset search

Use `integrations/ipfs_datasets/legal.py` as the single legal acquisition seam.

Recommended use inside complaint-generator:

- retrieve statutes, regulations, administrative materials, and case-source records through normalized wrappers
- normalize all authorities into one storage model with provenance and ranking metadata
- connect authorities to claim elements and procedural requirements, not just to high-level claim types

Primary next improvements:

- richer authority ranking fields such as jurisdiction, precedential value, and procedural relevance
- parsing of authority full text when available
- contradiction and adverse-authority handling

### 2. Web archiving, search engines, and scraper workflows

Use `integrations/ipfs_datasets/search.py` plus `integrations/ipfs_datasets/scraper_daemon.py` as the acquisition layer for public factual material.

Recommended use inside complaint-generator:

- use current-web and archive search to discover factual support
- convert valuable discoveries into normalized evidence records instead of leaving them as transient results
- prefer queue-backed scraper execution for operator or daemon workflows
- retain direct bounded-run execution for smoke tests, debugging, and one-off investigations

Primary next improvements:

- archive-first acquisition for high-value URLs
- version-aware page history and temporal contradiction checks
- better clustering of duplicate pages found through multiple engines and archives

### 3. Document parsing and corpus services

Use `integrations/ipfs_datasets/documents.py` as the single parse contract for uploaded evidence, scraped pages, and eventually legal authorities.

Recommended use inside complaint-generator:

- normalize raw bytes and fetched page content into parse outputs with text, chunks, and summary metadata
- preserve transform lineage for later graph extraction and logic translation
- feed chunk outputs into graph and fact extraction rather than maintaining hook-local parse shapes

Primary next improvements:

- make legal authority text flow through the same parse contract when full text is available
- expose one shared corpus object model for evidence and authorities

### 4. Graph database and knowledge-graph usage

Use `integrations/ipfs_datasets/graphs.py` to connect parsed artifacts to graph persistence and support queries, while keeping `complaint_phases/` as the canonical workflow graph surface.

Recommended use inside complaint-generator:

- keep the complaint-phase knowledge, dependency, and legal graphs as the in-memory decision model
- project parsed evidence and authorities into those graphs
- add graph snapshot persistence only through the adapter boundary

Primary next improvements:

- backing graph-store persistence beyond the current local created-versus-reused snapshot semantics
- deeper graph-backed support tracing by claim element on top of the new typed graph snapshot and support-result contracts; review-facing support links now already carry stored `graph_trace` packets from evidence and authority records
- a coverage matrix built from facts, support edges, graph output, and validation state

### 5. GraphRAG and information organization

Use `integrations/ipfs_datasets/graphrag.py` after graph persistence and fact organization are sufficiently stable.

Recommended use inside complaint-generator:

- refine ontologies from complaint narratives, evidence corpora, and legal authority bundles
- score support paths, not just individual records
- feed ontology quality and structural gaps into follow-up planning and denoising

Primary next improvements:

- ontology generation and validation workflows
- support-path scoring for claim overviews
- graph-quality-guided follow-up planning

### 6. Theorem provers and formal logic

Use `integrations/ipfs_datasets/logic.py` as the sole formal-reasoning boundary.

Recommended use inside complaint-generator:

- translate claim elements into predicate templates
- translate extracted facts and authority-derived rules into grounded predicates
- run contradiction and sufficiency checks only after fact and graph layers are stable enough to support them

Primary next improvements:

- implement the logic adapter beyond capability probing
- define claim-type-specific predicate templates
- persist validation runs, failed premises, and contradictory predicates

### 7. Workspace Dataset Bundles (Index + Package)

Workspace dataset bundles are implemented in `ipfs_datasets_py.processors.legal_data` and expose a docket-like bundle layout for mixed evidence corpora (emails, chat exports, drive dumps, or web captures). Use workspace bundles when you want to stage a large evidence workspace with knowledge graphs, BM25, and vector indices ready now while deferring deeper downstream processing.

Recommended use inside complaint-generator:

- ingest mixed evidence exports into a normalized workspace dataset object
- generate knowledge graphs and retrieval indices for faster later review
- package workspace datasets into chain-loadable artifacts for IPFS and parquet-first storage

Preferred CLI workflow:

```bash
# Export a single-parquet workspace bundle from a JSON workspace payload
ipfs-datasets workspace --action export --input-path /path/to/workspace.json \
  --output-parquet /tmp/workspace_bundle.parquet --json

# Package a chain-loadable workspace bundle (parquet + optional CAR)
ipfs-datasets workspace --action package --input-path /path/to/discord_export.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/workspace_bundle --package-name workspace_bundle --json

# Inspect the packaged bundle summary
ipfs-datasets workspace --action package-summary --input-path /tmp/workspace_bundle/bundle_manifest.json --json
```

Direct upstream usage (when adapter integration is not required yet):

```python
from ipfs_datasets_py.processors.legal_data import (
    WorkspaceDatasetBuilder,
    package_workspace_dataset,
)

builder = WorkspaceDatasetBuilder()
dataset = builder.build_from_workspace({
    "workspace_id": "ws-01",
    "workspace_name": "Evidence Workspace",
    "documents": [{"id": "doc-1", "title": "Email", "text": "Sample evidence"}],
})

package = package_workspace_dataset(dataset, output_dir="/tmp/workspace_bundle", package_name="workspace_bundle")
print(package["manifest_json_path"])
```

### 8. Vector search and MCP gateway features

`integrations/ipfs_datasets/vector_store.py` and `integrations/ipfs_datasets/mcp_gateway.py` should remain adapter seams until there is a concrete complaint-generator workflow that needs them.

Recommended use inside complaint-generator:

- vector search should eventually augment ranking and hybrid retrieval once corpus indexing exists
- MCP gateway features should only be integrated where there is a clear operational need for tool exposure or remote orchestration

Primary next improvements:

- corpus indexing and hybrid retrieval for vector search
- clearly scoped MCP workflows instead of generic tool passthrough

## Recommended Information Organization Model

The complaint generator should organize information around claim-element support, not around raw source categories.

The core organization layers should be:

1. Raw artifacts: uploads, archived pages, scraped pages, authority texts.
2. Parsed corpus data: normalized text, chunks, parse metadata, transform lineage.
3. Extracted facts: fact records with chunk-level provenance where available.
4. Support structure: links from facts, artifacts, and authorities to claim elements.
5. Graph structure: entity, event, authority, and support edges across the case.
6. Validation structure: proof gaps, contradictions, and unresolved requirements.

The central operator-facing product artifact should become a claim-element coverage matrix that answers:

- what supports this element
- what contradicts this element
- what is missing
- what came from archived web evidence versus uploaded evidence versus legal authority
- what remains only an inference versus a grounded fact

## Recommended Execution Order

The highest-value order remains:

1. Finish the shared parse and corpus contract.
2. Add shared fact and support organization across evidence and authorities.
3. Persist graph snapshots and support queries behind the graph adapter.
4. Add claim-element coverage matrix reporting.
5. Integrate GraphRAG support-path scoring.
6. Integrate theorem-prover-backed validation.

For milestone-level ownership, file targets, and acceptance tests, use [docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_MILESTONE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_MILESTONE_CHECKLIST.md) and [docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_FILE_WORKLIST.md](docs/IPFS_DATASETS_PY_FILE_WORKLIST.md) as the execution companions to this guide.

This order matters because theorem proving and GraphRAG become much more useful once the system already has stable parse outputs, fact records, support edges, and graph lineage.

## Anti-Patterns To Avoid

Avoid these integration mistakes:

- direct production imports from `ipfs_datasets_py` internals outside the adapter layer
- per-hook private parse contracts that fragment chunk and provenance handling
- graph persistence that bypasses complaint-phase graph semantics
- prover experiments that operate on raw text instead of grounded facts and claim predicates
- long-running worker processes that execute scraper loops without claimed work

## Definition of Success

The `ipfs_datasets_py` integration should be considered successful when complaint-generator can:

- search and archive factual and legal source material reproducibly
- normalize those sources into shared artifact, chunk, fact, and provenance records
- organize support by claim element with graph-backed and provenance-backed explanations
- detect gaps and contradictions before draft generation
- expose review-ready support packets and coverage summaries
- operate in full, partial, and degraded environments without breaking mediator workflows

from hacc_integration.keywords import COMPLAINT_KEYWORDS

class HybridDocumentIndexer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.complaint_keywords = COMPLAINT_KEYWORDS
    
    async def index_document(self, text, metadata):
        # Vector indexing is routed through complaint-generator's adapter seam.
        vector_result = create_vector_index(
            [{"text": text, "metadata": metadata}],
            index_name="complaint_documents",
        )
        
        # Keyword tagging (HACC)
        tags = self._extract_keywords(text)
        risk_score = self._calculate_risk(tags)
        
        return {
            'vector_indexed': vector_result.get('status') != 'unavailable',
            'vector_status': vector_result.get('status'),
            'keywords': tags,
            'risk_score': risk_score
        }
    
    def _extract_keywords(self, text):
        """HACC's keyword extraction logic."""
        found = []
        text_lower = text.lower()
        for kw in self.complaint_keywords:
            if kw.lower() in text_lower:
                found.append(kw)
        return found
```

### 4. Legal Analysis → Keep HACC's Domain Knowledge

**HACC's unique value: Legal pattern extraction**

```python
# hacc_integration/legal_patterns.py

import re
from typing import List, Dict

COMPLAINT_LEGAL_TERMS = [
    r"\b(fair housing)\b",
    r"\b(discrimination)\b",
    r"\b(retaliation)\b",
    r"\b(reasonable accommodation)\b",
    r"\b(protected class)\b",
    r"\b(disparate (impact|treatment))\b",
    r"\b(42 U\.S\.C\.)",  # Federal housing law
    r"\b(Section 8)\b",
]

class ComplaintLegalPatternExtractor:
    """Extract complaint-relevant legal provisions from text."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns = [re.compile(p, re.IGNORECASE) for p in COMPLAINT_LEGAL_TERMS]
    
    def extract_provisions(self, text: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Extract legal provisions with context."""
        provisions = []
        
        for pattern in self.patterns:
            for match in pattern.finditer(text):
                start = max(0, match.start() - 200)
                end = min(len(text), match.end() + 200)
                context = text[start:end]
                
                provisions.append({
                    'term': match.group(0),
                    'context': context,
                    'position': match.start()
                })
        
        return provisions
```

**Integrate with ipfs_datasets_py's GraphRAG:**

```python
from integrations.ipfs_datasets.documents import parse_document_file
from integrations.ipfs_datasets.graphrag import build_ontology
from hacc_integration.legal_patterns import ComplaintLegalPatternExtractor

def analyze_legal_document(pdf_path):
    # Process through complaint-generator's adapter seam
    result = parse_document_file(pdf_path)
    
    # Extract legal provisions (HACC)
    extractor = ComplaintLegalPatternExtractor()
    provisions = extractor.extract_provisions(result.get('text', ''))
    
    # Build ontology payload through the adapter seam
    kg = build_ontology(result.get('text', ''))
    
    return {
        'text': result.get('text', ''),
        'legal_provisions': provisions,
        'knowledge_graph': kg
    }
```

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Complete Evidence Pipeline

```python
from integrations.ipfs_datasets.documents import parse_document_file
from integrations.ipfs_datasets.search import search_brave_web
from integrations.ipfs_datasets.vector_store import create_vector_index
from hacc_integration.legal_patterns import ComplaintLegalPatternExtractor
from hacc_integration.risk_scoring import ComplaintRiskScorer

class ComplaintEvidencePipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        # HACC domain knowledge
        self.legal_extractor = ComplaintLegalPatternExtractor()
        self.risk_scorer = ComplaintRiskScorer()
    
    async def process_complaint(self, complaint_text, keywords):
        # 1. Search for evidence
        search_query = f"site:gov {' OR '.join(keywords)}"
        results = search_brave_web(search_query, max_results=50)
        
        # 2. Download and process PDFs
        evidence = []
        for result in results:
            if result['url'].endswith('.pdf'):
                # Process through the adapter seam
                processed = parse_document_file(result['url'])
                
                # Extract legal provisions (HACC)
                provisions = self.legal_extractor.extract_provisions(processed.get('text', ''))
                
                # Calculate risk (HACC)
                risk = self.risk_scorer.calculate_risk(processed.get('text', ''), provisions)
                
                # Route vector indexing through the adapter seam
                vector_result = create_vector_index(
                    [{"text": processed.get('text', ''), "metadata": {"url": result['url']}}],
                    index_name="complaint_evidence",
                )
                
                evidence.append({
                    'url': result['url'],
                    'text': processed.get('text', ''),
                    'provider': processed.get('provider'),
                    'legal_provisions': provisions,
                    'risk_score': risk,
                    'vector_result': vector_result,
                    'parse_summary': processed.get('summary', {})
                })
        
        return evidence
```

### Example 2: Hybrid Search

```python
from integrations.ipfs_datasets.search import search_brave_web
from integrations.ipfs_datasets.vector_store import search_vector_index
from hacc_integration.keywords import COMPLAINT_KEYWORDS

class HybridComplaintSearch:
    def __init__(self):

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

```python
# tests/test_ipfs_datasets_integration.py

import pytest
from integrations.ipfs_datasets.documents import parse_document_file
from integrations.ipfs_datasets.search import search_brave_web
from hacc_integration.legal_patterns import ComplaintLegalPatternExtractor

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_pdf_processing_with_legal_extraction():
    """Test adapter-based document parsing + HACC legal extraction."""
    extractor = ComplaintLegalPatternExtractor()
    
    # Process test PDF
    result = parse_document_file('tests/data/sample_complaint.pdf')
    
    # Extract legal provisions
    provisions = extractor.extract_provisions(result.get('text', ''))
    
    # Verify
    assert result.get('text') is not None
    assert len(provisions) > 0
    assert any('discrimination' in p['term'].lower() for p in provisions)

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_brave_search_with_complaint_keywords():
    """Test adapter-based Brave search with complaint keywords."""
    results = search_brave_web('site:gov "fair housing" filetype:pdf', max_results=10)
    
    assert len(results) > 0
    assert all('url' in r for r in results)
```

## Cost Analysis

### API Costs

| Service | HACC Approach | ipfs_datasets_py Approach | Savings |
|---------|--------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Brave Search | $5/1000 queries | $5/1000 queries (but 90% cached) | **90%** |
| OCR Processing | ocrmypdf (CPU) | MultiEngineOCR (GPU) | **80% time = cost** |
| Storage | File system | IPFS (dedupe) | **50% storage** |

**Estimated Monthly Savings for 10,000 Complaints:**
- Brave API: $50/month → $5/month = **$45 saved**
- OCR compute: $200/month → $40/month = **$160 saved**
- Storage: $100/month → $50/month = **$50 saved**
- **Total: $255/month saved** (~85% reduction)
