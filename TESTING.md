## Running Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_log.py

# Run tests by marker
pytest -m unit
pytest -m integration
```

### Workspace Bundle Tooling (ipfs_datasets_py)

Workspace dataset bundle helpers (indexing + packaging) live in the `ipfs_datasets_py` submodule. Run these tests from within the submodule to validate the workspace dataset bundle flow:

```bash
cd ipfs_datasets_py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q \
  tests/unit/processors/test_workspace_dataset.py \
  tests/unit/processors/test_workspace_packaging.py \
  tests/unit/test_workspace_cli.py \
  tests/unit/test_workspace_bundle_export_script.py
```

### Optional Browser Smoke
The claim-support dashboard now includes an optional real-browser smoke test for the legacy testimony-link repair path:

```bash
# Install Playwright into the project venv
.venv/bin/pip install playwright

# Install a browser runtime once per machine
.venv/bin/python -m playwright install chromium

# Run the dashboard smoke test
.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_claim_support_review_playwright_smoke.py

# Run the unified site-flow browser suite
.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_complaint_generator_site_playwright.py
```

The smoke test starts a local FastAPI review surface, seeds one saved testimony row plus one proactively repaired legacy row in a temporary DuckDB, opens the real `/claim-support-review` page in Chromium, clicks `Load Review`, and verifies the rendered testimony summary and cards show both rows linked to `Protected activity`.

The site-flow suite mounts the unified review surface plus the legacy landing, home, chat, profile, and results pages, then verifies cross-page navigation, document generation handoff into claim review, and optimization-trace handoff back into review.

These Python Playwright suites are the source-of-truth browser regression because they drive the actual FastAPI review surface assembled by the application factory.

The repo also contains a Node Playwright compatibility suite exposed as `npm test:e2e`. That suite runs against `playwright/server.js`, a stubbed browser fixture server. Keep using the Python regression runners as the required gate for real route wiring and app-surface integration.

If Playwright is not installed, the test is collected and skipped cleanly.

For the full focused claim-support regression slice, use the repo-local runner:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_claim_support_review_regression.py
```

That command auto-includes the browser-backed Playwright coverage when both the Playwright package and Chromium runtime are installed. In browser mode it runs the focused pytest slice, including both the dashboard smoke and the cohesive site-flow suite, and then runs the JavaScript Playwright compatibility specs in `playwright/tests/navigation.spec.js` and `playwright/tests/complaint-flow.spec.js`. Use `--browser off` to force the non-browser slice or `--browser on` to require the full browser lane explicitly.

Use `--network on` when you want the same runner to opt into the network-gated package-surface tests as part of the same invocation. Keep the default `--network auto` behavior when you want the focused slice without forcing those package-surface checks.

VS Code also exposes this runner through the workspace tasks `Claim Support Regression`, `Claim Support Regression (No Browser)`, `Claim Support Regression (Require Browser)`, and `Claim Support Regression (Browser + Network)`.

The Run and Debug panel now mirrors those entry points with `Claim Support Regression`, `Claim Support Regression (No Browser)`, `Claim Support Regression (Require Browser)`, and `Claim Support Regression (Browser + Network)` launch configurations.

GitHub Actions now enforces the same focused slice in `.github/workflows/claim-support-regression.yml` with non-browser, browser-required, and browser-plus-network lanes.

### Standard Regression Gate

The default repo-level regression entrypoint is now:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_standard_regression.py
```

That helper defaults to the browser-inclusive `full` slice and covers the review API, dashboard flow, hooks, template rendering, document pipeline, formal document pipeline, the claim-support dashboard Playwright smoke, and the cohesive site-flow Playwright suite.

Equivalent entry points:

- `make regression`
- VS Code tasks `Standard Regression (Lean)`, `Standard Regression (Review)`, and `Standard Regression (Full)`
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/standard-regression.yml`

Maintenance rule:

- When you add or remove tests from `scripts/run_standard_regression.py`, update `.github/workflows/standard-regression.yml` path filters in the same change so CI triggers still match the executed slice.
- When you add or remove tests from `scripts/run_claim_support_review_regression.py`, update `.github/workflows/claim-support-regression.yml` path filters in the same change.
- Prefer high-confidence direct source files, runner scripts, and test files over speculative transitive dependencies when expanding workflow trigger paths.

### Current Validation Guidance
- Use `scripts/run_standard_regression.py` as the default gate for review-surface, workflow-guidance, and document-pipeline changes.
- Use `scripts/run_claim_support_review_regression.py` when you need the narrower claim-support-focused slice.
- Use `scripts/run_claim_support_review_regression.py --browser on --network on` when you want the browser-backed slice plus the network-gated package-surface checks as an explicit higher-confidence gate.
- Use `pytest -m "not integration"` for faster local feedback when you do not need external integrations.
- Treat the browser-backed suites as optional for local setup and required in the browser CI lane.
- Treat `npm test:e2e` as supplemental compatibility coverage when run on its own, but note that the browser-enabled claim-support runner now includes the required navigation and complaint-flow specs as part of the enforced browser lane.

### Canary Ops Smoke Checks

For reranker rollout tooling, run these lightweight checks before opening a PR:

```bash
# CI-safe canary wiring validation
python scripts/validate_canary_ops.py

# Focused validator test
pytest tests/test_canary_ops_validation.py -q

# Focused reranker integration regression
pytest tests/test_graph_phase2_integration.py -q --run-network --run-llm
```

In VS Code, equivalent one-click tasks are available in `.vscode/tasks.json`:
- `Canary: Validate Ops Wiring (CI-safe)`
- `Canary: Run + Export + Summarize Reranker Metrics`

For terminal-first workflows, use the top-level `Makefile` aliases:

```bash
make canary-validate
make canary-smoke
make canary-sample
```

## TDD Workflow

The project now follows Test-Driven Development principles:

1. **Write a failing test** - Define expected behavior
2. **Run the test** - Verify it fails (Red)
3. **Write minimal code** - Make the test pass
4. **Run the test** - Verify it passes (Green)
5. **Refactor** - Clean up while keeping tests green
6. **Repeat** - Continue for next feature

## Example: Adding a New Feature

```python
# 1. Write the test first (tests/test_new_feature.py)
def test_new_feature_behavior():
    """Test that new feature works as expected"""
    result = new_feature("input")
    assert result == "expected output"

# 2. Run tests (should fail)
pytest tests/test_new_feature.py

# 3. Implement the feature
def new_feature(input):
    return "expected output"

# 4. Run tests again (should pass)
pytest tests/test_new_feature.py
```

## Benefits of TDD

1. **Confidence**: Tests verify your code works as expected
2. **Documentation**: Tests serve as usage examples
3. **Refactoring**: Tests catch regressions when changing code
4. **Design**: Writing tests first leads to better API design
5. **Coverage**: Ensures all code paths are tested

## Next Steps

1. **Add More Tests**: Expand test coverage for uncovered modules
2. **Gate Selection**: Prefer the standard regression gate for review/document workflow changes before falling back to narrower slices
3. **Backend Dependencies**: Install full backend dependencies to run all tests
4. **Custom Fixtures**: Create reusable test fixtures in `conftest.py`
5. **Test Data**: Add test data fixtures for complex scenarios
