## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/endomorphosis/complaint-generator.git
cd complaint-generator
git submodule update --init --recursive
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Configure API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY="your-key"
```

### Package, CLI, MCP, and SDK Surfaces

After installation, the complaint workspace is available through package imports, installed console scripts, a stdio MCP server, and the browser SDK used by the unified workspace page.

**Python package imports:**

```python
from complaint_generator import ComplaintWorkspaceService, create_review_surface_app
from complaint_generator.mcp import handle_jsonrpc_message

service = ComplaintWorkspaceService()
session = service.get_session("did:key:example")
```

**Installed console scripts:**

```bash
complaint-generator --help
complaint-workspace session --user-id did:key:example
complaint-workspace answer --user-id did:key:example --question-id protected_activity --answer-text "Reported discrimination to HR"
complaint-workspace generate --user-id did:key:example --requested-relief "Back pay|Injunctive relief"

# Backward-compatible aliases are also installed
complaint-generator-workspace session --user-id did:key:example
```

**MCP stdio server:**

```bash
complaint-mcp-server

# Backward-compatible alias
complaint-generator-mcp
```

**Repo-local module entrypoints:**

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m complaint_generator.cli --help
.venv/bin/python -m complaint_generator.mcp_server
```

**Browser SDK and unified workspace page:**

- The browser SDK is served from `/static/complaint_mcp_sdk.js`
- The unified workspace is available at `/workspace`
- The workspace page uses the same complaint service contract exposed by the package, CLI, and MCP server

### Running

**CLI Mode (Interactive):**
```bash
python run.py --config config.llm_router.json
```

**Web Server Mode:**
```bash
# Edit config.llm_router.json: "APPLICATION": {"type": ["server"]}
python run.py --config config.llm_router.json
# Access at http://localhost:8000
```

**Review Surface Mode:**
```bash
python run.py --config config.review_surface.json
# Access the operator dashboard at http://localhost:8000/claim-support-review
# Access the formal complaint builder at http://localhost:8000/document
```

### Regression Shortcuts

**Standard Regression:**

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_standard_regression.py
```

Also available via:

- VS Code tasks `Standard Regression (Lean)`, `Standard Regression (Review)`, and `Standard Regression (Full)`
- Run and Debug entries with the same three labels
- Make targets `package-install-smoke`, `regression`, `regression-lean`, `regression-review`, and `regression-full`
- Make targets `complaint-workspace-cli` and `complaint-mcp-server`
- VS Code tasks `Complaint Workspace CLI` and `Complaint MCP Server`
- Run and Debug entries `Complaint Workspace CLI` and `Complaint MCP Server`
- GitHub Actions workflow `standard-regression.yml`

The helper now defaults to the browser-inclusive `full` slice so the review, template, document, and Playwright workflow contracts stay gated together.

The browser coverage in that full slice now includes both the claim-support dashboard smoke and the cohesive site-flow suite that exercises landing, account, chat, profile, results, builder, review, and optimization-trace navigation under one FastAPI surface.

The review and full slices also gate the packaged complaint workspace surface:

- `tests/test_complaint_generator_package.py` validates the importable package API, JSON-RPC tool calls, and fresh-session complaint generation.
- `tests/test_complaint_generator_package_surface.py` validates the installed console scripts and broader package exports.
- `tests/test_complaint_generator_site_playwright.py` validates the `/workspace` page using the shared browser MCP SDK against the real FastAPI review surface.

There is also a dedicated install-smoke helper for the installed console scripts:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e . --no-deps
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_package_install_smoke.py --json
```

The standard regression workflow runs that helper in a separate `package-install-smoke` CI job before the broader regression lane.

The repo also includes a separate Node Playwright compatibility suite available through `npm test:e2e`, but that path runs against a stubbed server for browser-level compatibility checks. The Python regression runners remain the authoritative browser gate for the real FastAPI site surface.

The stubbed Playwright server defaults to port `19030` so it does not collide as easily with local app servers already using `19000`. You can still override the port per run with `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_PORT`, for example `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_PORT=19045 npm run test:e2e:navigation`.

The browser-focused UI/UX optimizer and screenshot-audit workflow now default to the full JavaScript complaint journey:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:e2e:list
npm run test:e2e:complaint-flow
npm run test:e2e:navigation

.venv/bin/python -m complaint_generator.ui_ux_workflow \
  --screenshot-dir artifacts/ui-audit/screenshots \
  --output-dir artifacts/ui-audit/reviews

complaint-workspace browser-audit --screenshot-dir artifacts/ui-audit/screenshots
complaint-workspace optimize-ui --screenshot-dir artifacts/ui-audit/screenshots
python3 -m complaint_generator.ui_optimizer_daemon start \
  --user-id demo-user \
  --daemon-root artifacts/ui-optimizer-daemon/demo-user \
  --poll-seconds 1800 \
  --max-rounds 2 \
  --goal "keep export and testimony actions obvious" \
  --goal "make the generated complaint read like a formal pleading" \
  --use-llm-draft \
  --json
```

That browser journey explicitly drives intake, evidence capture, claim review, draft generation, export downloads, complaint-output analysis, actor/critic review, and browser-audit handoffs. The Playwright spec at `playwright/tests/complaint-flow.spec.js` now asserts that the generated markdown and PDF still read like a formal pleading rather than a generic summary.

The overnight daemon wraps that same complaint journey into a long-running loop, leaving status JSON, logs, screenshots, export reviews, and closed-loop optimizer artifacts under `artifacts/ui-optimizer-daemon/<user-id>`. Use `python3 -m complaint_generator.ui_optimizer_daemon status --user-id demo-user --daemon-root artifacts/ui-optimizer-daemon/demo-user --json` to check whether it is still running, and `python3 -m complaint_generator.ui_optimizer_daemon stop --user-id demo-user --daemon-root artifacts/ui-optimizer-daemon/demo-user --json` to stop it cleanly.

**Claim Support Regression:**

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_claim_support_review_regression.py
```

Also available via:

- VS Code task `Claim Support Regression` with `No Browser`, `Require Browser`, and `Browser + Network` variants
- GitHub Actions workflow `claim-support-regression.yml` for the focused claim-support slice

The focused claim-support workflow now also runs the packaged console-script smoke as a separate `package-install-smoke` job before the matrix lanes.

When browser coverage is enabled, the focused slice runs the current template, real-browser, and stub-browser surfaces together so route registration, workspace SDK behavior, and unified navigation stay aligned.

The current focused review/browser coverage is centered on:

- `tests/test_claim_support_review_template.py`
- `tests/test_complaint_generator_site_playwright.py`
- `playwright/tests/navigation.spec.js`

The package/import/entrypoint coverage for the install surface is in `tests/test_complaint_generator_package_surface.py`.

For local editor use, there is also a `Package Install Smoke` VS Code task and matching Run and Debug entry.

If you need to proactively normalize older claim-support testimony rows after upgrading the review workflow, run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/backfill_claim_testimony_links.py \
    --db-path statefiles/claim_support.duckdb \
    --dry-run

.venv/bin/python scripts/backfill_claim_testimony_links.py \
    --db-path statefiles/claim_support.duckdb
```

The dry run reports legacy testimony rows that can be canonically linked to registered claim elements without updating the database. The non-dry-run invocation applies those repairs in place.

**HACC Regression:**

```bash
# Lightweight HACC unit slice
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_hacc_unit_regression.py

# Grounding-focused HACC regression without the live smoke run
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_hacc_grounding_regression.py --skip-smoke
```

The lightweight slice covers the HACC evidence loader, HACC complaint synthesis, and HACC adversarial-report runner. The grounding slice adds the HACC seed-generation checks and can optionally run the heavier live smoke path.
The lightweight slice also covers adversarial session intake-prompt regressions that shape HACC-specific questioning and recovery behavior.
For the sibling HACC repository's adversarial runner CLI contracts, you can also run:

```bash
make hacc-adversarial-runner HACC_REPO_DIR=../HACC
```

That validates the HACC-side runner parser, JSON mode, stdout summaries, workflow-phase autopatch CLI flags, and operator-facing output contracts in `../HACC/tests/test_hacc_adversarial_runner.py`.

To inspect an existing grounded HACC run without rerunning research, upload, or synthesis, use:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/show_hacc_grounded_history.py

.venv/bin/python scripts/show_hacc_grounded_history.py --list-runs

.venv/bin/python scripts/show_hacc_grounded_history.py --json

.venv/bin/python scripts/show_hacc_grounded_history.py \
    --output-dir output/hacc_grounded/<run_id>

.venv/bin/python scripts/show_hacc_grounded_history.py --output-dir previous
.venv/bin/python scripts/show_hacc_grounded_history.py --output-dir last-successful
```

That helper can first list the available grounded runs, the current alias targets, the best candidate to resume, and ready-to-run inspection and operational commands, then summarize the current grounded workflow status, recent transitions, completed grounded worksheet state, refreshed grounding state, and grounded follow-up answer summary for the selected run directory. The recommended operational command is stage-aware: it suggests a grounded pipeline rerun for pre-follow-up runs and switches to complaint synthesis when a worksheet-backed resume is ready. When a saved run summary is available, the rerun command preserves the original query, claim type, preset, and search-mode flags, and when a persisted grounded worksheet is present it can also emit a rerun-plus-synthesis command with `--synthesize-complaint` and `--completed-grounded-intake-worksheet`. It accepts `latest`, `previous`, and `last-successful` aliases in addition to an explicit run directory.

Example output:

```text
Output directory: output/hacc_grounded/20260322_120000
Workflow stage: post_grounded_follow_up
Recorded transitions: 2
Next action: continue_drafting (document_generation)
Completed grounded worksheet items: 3
Refreshed grounding status: chronology_supported
Grounded follow-up answers: 3
```

Also available via:

- VS Code tasks `HACC Unit Regression`, `HACC Grounding Regression`, and `HACC Grounded History`
- VS Code task `HACC Adversarial Runner Tests`
- Run and Debug entries `HACC Unit Regression`, `HACC Grounding Regression`, `HACC Grounding Regression (No Smoke)`, `HACC Grounded History`, and `HACC Adversarial Runner Tests`
- Make targets `hacc-unit`, `hacc-grounding`, `hacc-grounding-no-smoke`, `hacc-grounded-history`, and `hacc-adversarial-runner`
- GitHub Actions workflow `hacc-unit-regression.yml`
- Manual workflow `hacc-grounding-regression.yml`

The helper defaults to the latest run under `output/hacc_grounded`. Set the grounded run directory explicitly when using `make`:

```bash
make hacc-grounded-history HACC_GROUNDED_RUN_DIR=output/hacc_grounded/<run_id>
```

**Hugging Face Router Quick Start:**
```bash
export HF_TOKEN="your-huggingface-token"

# Optional: override the routing model or the reasoning target used by the smoke tests
export HF_ARCH_ROUTER_MODEL="katanemo/Arch-Router-1.5B"
export HF_ROUTER_ARCH_REASONING_MODEL="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"

# General server mode with Hugging Face router as the active backend.
# The shipped config now uses Arch-Router to choose between legal-reasoning and drafting models.
python run.py --config config.huggingface_router.json

# Review surface and formal complaint builder with the same auto-routing profile
python run.py --config config.review_surface.huggingface_router.json

# Optional: real network smoke test for the HF router adapter path
HF_TOKEN="$HF_TOKEN" .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
    tests/test_ipfs_llm_huggingface_router.py \
    -k live_huggingface_router_smoke \
    --run-network --run-llm

# Optional: real network smoke test through the formal complaint API path
HF_TOKEN="$HF_TOKEN" .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
    tests/test_document_pipeline.py \
    -k live_huggingface_router_optimization_smoke \
    --run-network --run-llm

# Optional: real network smoke test through the review-surface app path
HF_TOKEN="$HF_TOKEN" .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
    tests/test_document_pipeline.py \
    -k review_surface_live_huggingface_router_optimization_smoke \
    --run-network --run-llm
```

**Adversarial Autopatch (Non-Interactive):**
```bash
# Demo mode (no live LLM required)
./.venv/bin/python run.py --config config.adversarial_autopatch_demo.json

# Live mode with Hugging Face router (requires HF_TOKEN)
export HF_TOKEN="your-huggingface-token"
./.venv/bin/python run.py --config config.adversarial_autopatch_live.json

# Batch mode: 4 sessions, 2 parallel
./.venv/bin/python run.py --config config.adversarial_autopatch_live_batch.json

# Multi-backend: hf-router → codex_cli → accelerate fallback
./.venv/bin/python run.py --config config.adversarial_autopatch_live_multibackend.json
```

The demo config sets `demo_backend=true`. The live config prefers the Hugging Face router first (requires `HF_TOKEN` or `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN`). All configs emit a summary JSON payload to stdout and write patch artifacts under `tmp/` by default. The live runner records `runtime.selected_backend_id` and `runtime.probe_attempts` in the output payload.

The formal complaint builder and `/api/documents/formal-complaint` endpoint also support affidavit-specific exhibit controls. Use `affidavit_supporting_exhibits` to provide a curated affidavit exhibit list, or set `affidavit_include_complaint_exhibits=false` when the affidavit should not inherit the complaint's exhibit list by default.

The same formal complaint payload now carries claim-level support summaries and drafting-readiness source-context counts, so the builder can show whether each count is currently grounded in evidence, authority, archived captures, or fallback-only authority references without requiring a separate dashboard round-trip.

Agentic document optimization can also use Hugging Face Inference through the same OpenAI-compatible router endpoint documented for Chat UI `llm-router`. Set `optimization_provider` to `huggingface_router`, choose a Hugging Face model in `optimization_model_name`, and pass `optimization_llm_config.base_url=https://router.huggingface.co/v1` when you need to override the default router URL. The `/document` review surface now exposes these optimization controls directly, including iteration/target tuning, routed model selection, basic router overrides, an advanced JSON editor for `optimization_llm_config`, and optional IPFS trace persistence.

If you want automatic model selection for optimization requests, include `optimization_llm_config.arch_router` with a routing model such as `katanemo/Arch-Router-1.5B` and a route map like `legal_reasoning -> meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` and `drafting -> Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct`.

When `enable_agentic_optimization=true`, the formal complaint response adds a top-level `document_optimization` report summarizing the post-knowledge-graph actor/mediator/critic loop. The current report shape includes the optimization method/backend, initial and final scores, accepted iteration count, optimized section names, router/IPFS status, router usage diagnostics, upstream optimizer selection, stage-level provider selection, packet projection summaries, serialized initial/final critic reviews, a compact section history, and an optional trace CID when `optimization_persist_artifacts=true`. The `/document` preview surfaces those summaries directly after each generation run, including effective provider/model, provider-source, task-complexity, and selected-route details from the critic metadata when routed LLM calls are available.

**Agentic Scraper CLI:**
```bash
python scripts/agentic_scraper_cli.py enqueue \
    --keywords employment discrimination retaliation \
    --domains eeoc.gov dol.gov \
    --iterations 3

python scripts/agentic_scraper_cli.py worker --once
python scripts/agentic_scraper_cli.py queue --user-id cli-user

python scripts/agentic_scraper_cli.py run \
    --keywords employment discrimination retaliation \
    --domains eeoc.gov dol.gov \
    --iterations 3

## 🧭 Canary Ops (Reranker Rollout)

Use the built-in workspace tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json` for rollout monitoring:

- `Canary: Run + Export + Summarize Reranker Metrics`
- `Canary: Summarize Latest Reranker Metrics Export`
- `Canary: Generate Sample + Summarize Reranker Metrics`
- `Canary: Validate Ops Wiring (CI-safe)`

You can also run CI-safe validation directly:

```bash
python scripts/validate_canary_ops.py
```

Or use the top-level Makefile aliases:

```bash
make canary-validate
make canary-smoke
make canary-sample
```

See [Canary configuration details →](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

---

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Complaint Processing

```python
from mediator import Mediator
from backends import LLMRouterBackend

# Initialize with the router-backed Codex route
backend = LLMRouterBackend(id='llm-router', provider='codex', model='gpt-5.3-codex')
mediator = Mediator(backends=[backend])

# Process complaint
mediator.state.complaint = "I was fired after reporting safety violations..."
result = mediator.analyze_complaint_legal_issues()

print("Claim Types:", result['classification']['claim_types'])
print("Applicable Laws:", result['statutes'])
```

### Three-Phase Workflow

```python
from complaint_phases import PhaseManager

manager = PhaseManager(mediator=mediator)

# Phase 1: Intake
manager.start_three_phase_process(initial_text)
while manager.current_phase == 'denoising':
    question = manager.get_next_question()
    answer = input(question)
    manager.process_answer(question, answer)

# Phase 2 & 3: Evidence gathering and formalization
manager.advance_to_evidence_phase()
manager.discover_web_evidence()
manager.advance_to_formalization_phase()
complaint = manager.generate_formal_complaint()
```

### Export a Filing Draft

```python
draft = mediator.generate_formal_complaint(
    district='New Mexico',
    case_number='1:26-cv-____'
)

docx_result = mediator.export_formal_complaint(
    'statefiles/formal_complaint.docx',
    district='New Mexico',
    case_number='1:26-cv-____'
)

pdf_result = mediator.export_formal_complaint(
    'statefiles/formal_complaint.pdf',
    district='New Mexico',
    case_number='1:26-cv-____'
)
```

The filing draft includes a traditional court header and caption, nature of the action,
jurisdiction and venue, factual allegations, claims for relief with legal standards,
requested relief, and linked exhibits sourced from stored evidence.
